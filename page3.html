                        Working from 8 years old really showed me that money is not easy to make and therefore should be wisely invested/spent.
                        <br>
                        At the farm I would collect strawberrys and other fruits.
                        <br>
                        When i was delivering newspapers at 13 years old I was bassically enslaved as i was working for 3 hours everyday and at the end of that month i was payed 30$.

                            When I turned 14 years old I would do sales to sales during the summer seliing floor heating systems.
                            <br>
                            After that I worked in Construction from 16 years old to 18 years old during the summer. Where I learned that studying is important.
                            <br>
                            While I was getting prepared for Univeristy I became a Virtual Security Guard where i would just supervize monitors all night.
