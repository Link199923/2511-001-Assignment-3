            Working from 8 years old really showed me that money is not easy to make and therefore should be wisely invested/spent.
            <br>
            At the farm I would collect strawberrys and other fruits.
            <br>

            <br>
            After that I worked in Construction from 16 years old to 18 years old during the summer. Where I learned that studying is important.
            <br>
