                I was born in Bogota Colombia. I moved from Bogota to Dolores and  Ibague before coming to Canada.

                After living in quebec for 8 years I moved to Calgary with familly in order for my parents to find work.
                <br> 
                Moving to another city was and its been really complicated, it is  hard to meet people in the community's, we have no support from familly or friends.
                <br>
                We have been living life on survival mode (socially) ever since we came as refuges from Colombia.
